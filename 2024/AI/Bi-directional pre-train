--- Introduction ---

timne series provide valueable insidees for status and outcomes. usefull application =  achieve accurate sequenceto-vector (seq2vec) prediction tasks for centain deasess [2]

there are threee methods on a noramalized time-serise[3] Gnereative, masking based, dropping based [3.2, 3.3, 3.4] 
recent advancement  PTM[4] and computer vision led to tim-series represntation learning.

supervised learning divies into two - masked based and dropping based pre-training [5]

problem = they suffer from data distribution shift[6]

GPT adopts a next-token
prediction task, which effectively preserves both the original
distribution and time-series shapelets without changing the data but its poential in time-serise is still underexplored 


in this study. focues towards improving downstream seq2vec prediction tasks (Bidirectional Timely Generative Pre-trained
Transformer (BiTimelyGPT)) that  integrates bidirectionality into generative pre-training

benifits =  preserving the original distribution and time-series shapelets without any data alterations.

The key contributions of our research are threefold:
1. a Next-Previous-Token Prediction pre-training task preserves the original data distribution and time-series
shapelets (Figure 1);
2. a Bidirectionally Alternating AutoRegressive Modeling (BAAR) framework alternately models left-to-right
and right-to-left information, learning deep bidirectional contexts for discriminative tasks (Figure 2);
3. the full-rank forward and backward attention matrices
exhibit expressive representation power (Figure 2).

Techniques and AI Knowledge Used
Transformer Architecture: This section discusses the basic structure and function of Transformer models, which are pivotal in modern natural language processing. The architecture consists of multiple layers of Transformer blocks, each comprising a multi-head self-attention layer followed by a feed-forward layer. Key components include:

Multi-head Self-Attention: This mechanism allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously, improving its ability to understand context.
Encoder-Decoder Structure: Typical in many Transformer models, allowing them to process and generate sequences effectively.
Attention Mechanisms:

Bidirectional Attention: Used in BERT, captures context from both directions (left-to-right and right-to-left) simultaneously.
Causal (Unidirectional) Attention: Used in GPT, only considers previous tokens for predicting the next token, making it suitable for generative tasks.
Bidirectional Recurrent Representation Learning:

BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory): Trains separate forward and backward LSTMs to capture context from both directions, concatenating their hidden states.
ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models): Similar to BiLSTM but concatenates outputs in the final layer, providing shallow bidirectional context.
Recurrent Transformer (RetNet):

Extrapolatable Position Embedding (xPos): Encodes relative positional information into the Query and Key matrices to handle token distances.
Retention Mechanism: Reformulates the retention process as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), capturing temporal dependencies efficiently.
BiTimelyGPT:

BAAR Framework (Bidirectional Alternating Attention Retention): Alternates between forward and backward attention across layers, enhancing bidirectional representation learning for time-series data.
Point of the Paragraph
The paragraph aims to provide a detailed overview of various advanced techniques in transformer-based AI models, emphasizing their architecture and mechanisms. It explains the evolution from traditional transformers 
like GPT and BERT to more sophisticated models like RetNet and BiTimelyGPT. The focus is on how these models achieve bidirectionality and capture temporal dependencies, particularly in time-series forecasting and other tasks requiring deep contextual understanding.
The discussion highlights the unique contributions of the BAAR framework in enhancing bidirectional representation learning, which is crucial for improving the performance of autoregressive models like BiTimelyGPT in both generative and discriminative tasks.




Detailed Explanation of BiTimelyGPT Methodology
1. Overview of BiTimelyGPT
BiTimelyGPT is designed to handle time-series data with bidirectional capabilities using a unique convolution-subsampling tokenizer and alternating autoregressive modeling. It aims to pre-train temporal representations for fine-tuning in sequence-to-vector (seq2vec) tasks.

2. Input Processing
Time-Series Input: A sequence of time-series data, denoted as {x1, x2, ..., xT}, where each xt has V features.
Convolution-Subsampling Tokenizer: Reduces the input from T × V dimensions to N × V (N < T) using two 1-D convolution layers. This reduces the sequence length while preserving feature dimensions.
Input Embedding: The tokens are then projected onto an embedding space X ∈ RN×d, with special [SOS] (start of sequence) and [EOS] (end of sequence) tokens added.
3. Bidirectional Alternating AutoRegressive (BAAR) Modeling
The BAAR framework introduces bidirectionality in autoregressive models by alternating between left-to-right and right-to-left information flows based on layer indices.

Forward Model (Odd Layers): In odd-indexed layers (l ∈ {1, 3, ..., L-1}), the model predicts the next timestep xt given the past context (x1, ..., xt-1). This forms a history-dependent representation vector.
Backward Model (Even Layers): In even-indexed layers (l ∈ {2, 4, ..., L}), the model predicts the previous timestep xt given the future context (xt+1, ..., xT). This forms a future-dependent representation vector.
4. BAAR Framework Illustration
Forward Attention: Starts with the [SOS] token to predict tokens from left to right. The [EOS] token summarizes information from all timesteps.
Backward Attention: Starts with the [EOS] token to predict tokens from right to left, reconstructing the sequence in reverse.
Final Layer: The [SOS] token aggregates sequence features for downstream tasks.
5. BiTimelyGPT Architecture
BiTimelyGPT employs the BAAR framework to alternate between forward and backward information flows:

Forward Retention (Odd Layers): Models left-to-right information using a lower triangular decay matrix.
Backward Retention (Even Layers): Models right-to-left information using an upper triangular decay matrix.
Bidirectional Pre-Training: The model predicts the next token in the L-1 layer and the previous token in the L layer. The loss is computed using mean squared error (MSE) for continuous signals or cross-entropy for discrete signals.
6. Full-Rankedness in BiTimelyGPT
Low-Rank Bottleneck in Self-Attention: Traditional self-attention mechanisms suffer from low-rank issues, leading to less expressive representation matrices.
Solution in BiTimelyGPT: Alternating forward and backward retention matrices ensures they are full-rank (non-zero diagonals), thus enabling more expressive and effective learning of bidirectional contexts.
7. Model Comparison
Data Preservation: BiTimelyGPT preserves the original data distribution and time-series shapelets.
Bidirectionality: BiTimelyGPT incorporates bidirectional modeling.
Full-Rankedness: BiTimelyGPT achieves full-rank retention matrices for better representation power.
