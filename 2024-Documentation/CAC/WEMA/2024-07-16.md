The documentation for sql of 'SELECT''WHERE' AND 'ORDER' IN PGADMIN. 

### Protected Object in PgAdmin ###

purpose : prevent deteltion in the foreignkey field to make sure deletion won't go through since its depending on it
and make sure of the referential intergrity 

so without protected. its easy to loss on the record and critial data part and causes of application shut down
but with protected key there is not a way to delete if something is depended on it.
